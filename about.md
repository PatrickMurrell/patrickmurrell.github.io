Driven by a desire to research, understand, and expose the truth in a sober manner, I attempt to present hard truths with Christian charity. I write on topics ranging from theology, to culture wars and much more.

Everything I produce will be posted here. Although I will be cross posting on other social media platforms as well.

*Thank You for reading!*
